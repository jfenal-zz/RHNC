Note for RHEL5 users :

- I'm using the latest version of Getopt::Long (2.38), not available
  for RHEL, but in Fedora 13 I use to develop. A simple "cpanp i
  Getopt::Long" will install the latest version
- for developers, I also use quite a few Test modules, one being
  Test::Script::Run not yet packaged for Fedora (waiting for my first
  Fedora contribution to be sponsored, BZ#608470) nor for EPEL.
- All those prerequisites are documented in Build.PL
